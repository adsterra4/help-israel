  	The best good deed you can do
Praise be to God</p><p>the Compassionate Association for the Worlds works in Israel, providing emergency aid and saving lives every day.

Without their help, many people have no hope of any humanitarian assistance at all.

For just $20, you can offer a food basket for an entire family.

Whoever needs his brother, God needs him, 

Brothers and sisters, please donate now for God's sake, and to feed your brothers and sisters who are in dire need of food to save their lives today.

Thank you
